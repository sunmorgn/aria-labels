## Overview

The Aria Labels plugin is designed to enhance accessibility on your WordPress website by adding `aria-hidden` and `aria-label` attributes to Gutenberg blocks. It is developed by Jacob Lodes, and more about his work can be found at [Jacob Lodes' Website](http://jlodes.com/).

## Features

-   Adds `aria-hidden` and `aria-label` attributes to Gutenberg blocks to improve accessibility.
-   The `aria-hidden` attribute is added to the block's HTML if it is set and true in the block's attributes.
-   The `aria-label` attribute is added to the block's HTML if it is set in the block's attributes.
-   The plugin can be updated directly from GitHub using the `Updater` class.
-   Automatically adds `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative images (image blocks with an empty alt attribute) to improve screen reader experience.

## Developer Notes

This section contains information for developers who want to contribute to the plugin or understand its structure for maintenance purposes.

-   File Structure: The main plugin file is `aria-labels.php`. The `includes` directory contains the PHP classes for each feature. The `admin` directory contains the code for the admin interface.
-   Key Classes: The `Aria_Attributes` class in `includes/class-aria-attributes.php` handles all server-side logic, including adding user-defined ARIA attributes and automatically handling attributes for decorative images. The `Updater` class in `includes/class-updater.php` handles updates to the plugin.
-   The `Aria_Attributes` class uses the `enqueue_block_editor_assets` action to enqueue the JavaScript file in the Gutenberg editor and the `render_block` filter to modify the block's final HTML.
-   The `Updater` class uses the GitHub API to fetch the latest release of the plugin and update it if necessary. It also adds details to the plugin popup and modifies the transient before updating plugins.
